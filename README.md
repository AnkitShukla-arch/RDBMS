## Types of Database Models-:
1.Hierarchial Database-: Data organized in tree structure 
                         one to many relationship
                         each child has only one parent 
ex-: organization strucutre

---

2.Network Database-: data organized as graph 
                     supports many to many relationships
                     child can have multiple parents 
ex-: organisation activity 
     telecom networks
     transports network

3.Relationship Dtabase Models: Data stored in tables 
                               Rows=Columns
                               Columns=Attributes

ex-: Mysql,oracle,MIcrosoft SQL Server

4.Object Oriented Database Model: Data is stored as objects, not tables
                                  These databses are designed to handle complex data structures such as 
FEATURES-: Objects
           Classes
           Inheritance
           Encapsulation 
ex: ObjectDB

5.Object Relational Database Model: Table based structure
                                    combination of relational+object oriented 
                                    data is still in tables 
                                    also supports complex data types and object concepts 
ex: PostgreSQL , Oracle

6.Cloud Databases: A cloud database operates in a virtual envionment hosted on cloud computing platforms.
                    It is designed for storing,managing,and executing data over the internet, providing flexibility and scalability.
ex: Amazon Web Services 
    Google Cloud Platforms 
    Microsoft Azure

## Types of Keys-:

1) Super Keys: Set of one or more columns that uniquely identify any row within a table .
2) Candidate Keys: A candidate key is a minimal set of columns (attributes) in a database table that can uniquely identify each record, serving as a potential choice for the primary key.
3) Composite Keys: A composite key is a primary key in a database formed by combining two or more columns (attributes) that, together, uniquely identify each record (row) in a table, even if individual columns have duplicate values
